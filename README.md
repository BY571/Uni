# Uni
In this Repository I store a few of my programms that I wrote for the university to review gathered data, evaluate the data, calculations of different tasks et cetera:

## Matlab
### Function Summenformel
You give that function a chemical formula like CH4 and the output of the funtion is the count of each element in that formula based on C, H and O elements.
For Example:
CH4 --> [1 4 0]
O2 --> [0 0 2]
C2H6 --> [2 6 0]
H2O --> [0 2 1]
C5H12 --> [5 12 0]
CH3OH --> [1 4 1]
HCOOH --> [1 2 2]

### Element Species Matrix
Here you give the function 'formel2esm' a chemical reaction equation and it returns the element specific matrix of that equation.
For Example:

and it returns:
